# Sorting2FullnamesAlphabetically
Write a program that prompts two users for their full names and sorts the names
alphabetically in the format “Surname, Forename”, e.g.
Name of user 1? Triona McSweeney
Name of user 2? Tim Manning
Manning, Tim
McSweeney, Triona
Hint: keyboard.next() reads a single word from the keyboard, keyboard.nextLine()
reads a string of words. Note: Assume users will always enter name as two words.
